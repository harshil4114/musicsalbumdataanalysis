## Music Album Data Analysis by Harshil Shinde
## ðŸ“– Project Description

This SQL project analyzes a fictional digital music store database to derive meaningful business insights. The project uses MySQL to query relational data imported from CSV files, simulating a real-world retail music environment.

The data includes information on customers, invoices, invoice line items, tracks, artists, albums, genres, and employees. All tables were imported into a MySQL schema named `musicproject`.

The analysis is divided into three levels of difficultyâ€”Easy, Moderate, and Advancedâ€”and addresses business questions such as:

- Who are the most valuable customers?
- Which cities and countries generate the most revenue?
- What are the most popular music genres in different countries?
- Who are the top Rock music listeners?
- Which artist is the top seller and who spends the most on them?

The project demonstrates key SQL skills including:
- Data filtering and sorting
- Aggregate functions
- Multiple table joins
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`

This work highlights how structured queries can answer important business questions and support data-driven decision-making in a retail or entertainment context.
